This project is meant for college users of DegreeWorks who would like
to automate their Process-What-If feature to plan their courses
for college degree completion. The program uses user data to
synthesize a javascript code that can be injected into the 
DegreeWorks console.

To use, first make a 'data.dgw' file with the list of your courses
as shown in the example file.
Then, run the 'FileEditor.java' program, which serves to create an
'output.js' file.

This 'output.js' file serves to be injected into the Web Console of 
DegreeWorks. Before injecting, inspect elment of the entry box in
the What-if section (where you are suppoed to enter the courses one-by-one).
This ensures that the console scope does not create an error.

You're welcome if this makes your life easier!
